# Synopsis

The logs section of the [FCCVienna repository](https://github.com/FCCVienna/FCCVienna) contains the following:
- meeting protocols for the FCCVienna meetups (note: there isn't a protocol for every meetups)
  - [2017](meetup-protocols-2017.md)
- curated lists of news articles (maintained by @robeerob, @lukastillmann and @ddcreationstudios)
  - [2017](newsflashes-2017.md)

## Motivation

The logfiles are there to help regular members keep an overview of what is going on in the FCCVienna Meetup group, and to make it easier for new or returning members to catch up.
