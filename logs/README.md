- [Meeting Protocols for the FCCVienna Meetups in 2017](meetup-protocols-2017.md)
- [Newsflashes 2017](newsflashes-2017.md)

## Motivation

The logs section is here to help regular members keep an overview of what is going on in the FCCVienna Meetup group, and to make it easier for new or returning members to catch up.
