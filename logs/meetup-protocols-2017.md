## 2017-02 Protocol
### Discussion about the future of FCCVienna and analyzing previous events

* Location
   - [Sector5](http://www.sektor5.at/) is good, but we are open for other locations
   - Try Stockwerk
* Logos/Banner
   - logos in green (like the twitter avatar)
   - adapt the size of banner
   - maybe the shield should be smaller
* Program
   - Mob Programming Sessions have been well received. Announce the topic in advance so people are able to prepare.
   - Talks are always appreciated
   - Programming 1 big project can be difficult since there is a high fluctuation.
   - JS algorithms would be nice
   - Helpdesk session was greatly appreciated
   - Other ideas were: Coding news, book presentations, more moderated discussions
* Size
   - The size of our community should be stimulated naturally and not forced to get bigger.
